This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive VBScript functions, specifically stack overflow due to excessive recursion depth. The `bug.vbs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected iterative version that avoids this issue.  The recursive approach is inherently limited by the available stack space, making it unsuitable for large inputs in VBScript. The iterative solution efficiently handles large factorials without risking a stack overflow.
